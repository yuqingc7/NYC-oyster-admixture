# NYC-oyster-admixture
This repository stores scripts for Hudson River Raritan and Long Island Sound oyster admixture manuscript "Spatial and temporal admixture patterns from farm oysters supplementing wild population recruitment". 

- ddRAD: scripts processing & analyzing ddRAD-Seq data
- lcWGS: scripts processing & analyzing low coverage WGS data
- figures: collection of scripts generating figures
- nemo_simulation: scripts performing nemo simulations and analyzing simulation results
- misc: comparison between ddRAD and lcWGS, coding region test, etc. 

## Acknowledgements
Scripts processing lcWGS data are mostly modified from [Therkildson Lab](https://github.com/therkildsen-lab/data-processing/blob/master/lcwgs_data_processing.md) scripts for low coverage whole-genome sequencing data processing and analysis.
